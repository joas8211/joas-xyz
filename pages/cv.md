# Curriculum Vitae

## Work experience

My work experience starts when I started studying IT in vocational school. The
first training lasted 6 months in the end of 2016 at atFlow. AtFlow is a local
company in Joensuu that specializes in developing websites with e-commerce and
information management features. After the half a year training I did paid work
for the summer 2017 (2 months) at atFlow.

When the summer was over I switched company to gain more experience. I started
training at Process Genius, a company that develops 3D user interfaces to manage
factories and other environments and machinery. After 4 months of training there
I got work agreement that was valid until further notice. I continued to do the
school work training while getting paid for it for another 2 months.

Autumn 2018 after my focused study period Process Genius didn't have work to
offer so I went back to atFlow for a fixed term work period. I resigned from
Process Genius and started working at atFlow with the current stable work
position. I ended my studies and continued to work there.

My current work experience in the field of web / software development is 5
years.
