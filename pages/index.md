# About Me

Hey! I'm Jesse Sivonen. A self-learned web developer with a profession in the
same field. I live in Joensuu, Finland, in the land of lakes and city of the
river. My hobbies are making music by myself and with my band Takauma, playing
computer and board games with my friends and programming large projects that I
cannot ever finish. I'm interested in providing non-programmers the ability to
create content in the web and interact with each other through the means of
technology. I also enjoy baking.
