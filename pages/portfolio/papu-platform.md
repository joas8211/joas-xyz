# Papu Platform

This has been a long-lasting hobby project of mine that is supposed to work as a
platform for my web projects and for other developers and website project
customers in the future too. I plan to make the platform hosted open source
project. Currently there is management and deployment automation for website
hosting. Currently I'm building a management console with Svelte for the API
I've built with Deno.

I've iterated few times for a CMS with Symfony and more recently Svelte with Git
hosted file-database. Below is a old prototype of said CMS.
