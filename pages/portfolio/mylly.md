# Mylly - The Game of Mills

Looking for a two player board game? Have you tried mills? You don't have to buy
the game to enjoy it. Here's a really simple web version of the game.

I made this game because my significant other was obsessed with the game of
mills. She played it in Assassin's Creed video game against an AI player and we
wanted to play against each other. She wasn't so obsessed with it to go buy it
and I couldn't find any proper free and light computer game version of it, so I
made it in a couple of hours.

You can try it at [mylly.joas.xyz](https://mylly.joas.xyz). The source code can
be found from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/joas8211/mylly).
