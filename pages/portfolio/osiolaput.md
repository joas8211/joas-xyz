# Osiolaput - Song Structure Memorization Tool

I needed a way to create visual representation of songs structure for band
training. So I created a tool to create them.

The way you create the printable song structure paper is by adding blocks of
different parts of the song, naming the parts and marking how many times they
should be played. The structure is saved in your web browser memory and can be
printed out by browsers normal printing means (eg. CTRL + P).

The tool is not visually interesting because it's not developed for large
audiences, but mainly for my personal use. It has been developed using
JavaScript, Svelte and Rollup.

You try the tool at [osiolaput.joas.xyz](https://osiolaput.joas.xyz). The source
code can be found from the
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/joas8211/osiolaput).
